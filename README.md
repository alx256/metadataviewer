# Unnamed MetaData Viewer

A command-line tool that can give you information about a file or directory. This was inspired by the macOS "Get Info" functionality, and I thought that it was original until I remembered that "ls -al" does basically everything this does- but hey! It will give you a nice (albeit incomplete) description for the file format!
